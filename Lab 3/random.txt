Dependency (Teacher to Library)

    A Teacher depends on Library.
    This is a weaker relationship.
    The Teacher class likely uses Library objects, but the lifecycle of Library is not tied to the Teacher.
    This could be, for example, a method in the Teacher class that takes a Library as a parameter.
